        <h2>Problem description</h2>
        <p>
          This project is a significant aspect of my work as the Principal
          Investigator of the NASA-funded grant that we call Dronehook. The goal
          of Dronehook is to build a fixed-wing craft capable of snagging a
          stationary package without landing. One of our major design
          requirements is to build a package collection station that is as
          cost-effective and low-tech as possible. Our preliminary solution is
          to use an ArUco marker and the associated Python library to detect the
          marker's location in the frame of an onboard camera and fly in its
          direction. However, a more robust solution is needed. As a result, I
          am exploring how we can use lightweight, realtime simulations to plan
          a 3D path from the plane's location to the package intercept point.
        </p>
        <h2>Initial approach</h2>
        <p>
          This problem lends itself to two main approaches. The first is to use
          differential equations to chart a path from the plane's current
          location to the goal. The second is a machine-learning based approach
          that produces a model that can reliably guide the plane to its
          destination using the camera feed as input. I believe the AI-based
          solution is a smarter first choice because it aligns with my current
          coursework.
        </p>
        <h2>Solution setup</h2>
        <p>
          The first step is to produce a fully-functional physics simulation
          environment that includes a 3D model of our plane, a representation of
          the ArUco marker, and a virtual camera. For this we will be using
          Gazebo. Next, we will determine how to read output from the physics
          simulator so we can use it as input to the machine learning function.
          Afterward we must automate the process to collect as much data as
          possible, leading to the final step of inputting the data into a
          Python machine learning model.
