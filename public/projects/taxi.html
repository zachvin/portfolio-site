        This is a data visualization project I worked on with my classmate Kabir
        (<a href="https://www.kabirmadan.com" target="_blank">kabirmadan.com</a>) at the end of
        freshman year for our Engineering Computing class.

        The richness of the raw data that we were working with made for some
        technical challenges; we had to be creative in terms of we could parse
        on the order of millions of data points, while keeping runtimes down and
        not exceeding our computers' limits. The benefit of having so many data
        points, however, was that we were able to generate graphs which show
        some fairly clear trends and tell convincing stories about matters such
        as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Taxi usage in New York City.
        As part of the process of generating these graphs, we often had to
        manipulate the data such that it could be formed into meaningful
        dataframes that could be graphed to convey a specific message. This
        meant having to be strategic about our use of given data (e.g.
        timestamps) to extract the data that we desired (e.g. day of the week).
