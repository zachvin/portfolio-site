      <p>
        I am currently working on this project as the next step in building an
        autonomous plane with package pickup capabilities. Using visual input
        from an onboard camera, the plane will use an ML model trained with many
        simulation flights. I am currently in the learning stage. I am studying
        from

        and plan to use Unreal Engine's UAV simulator to collect the data.
