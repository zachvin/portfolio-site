      <p>
        This project is the first in a series of projects to design a fully
        autonomous plane that uses computer vision and GPS to guide itself
        toward a package to pick up midflight. I used OpenCV Python and its
        included ArUco module to recognize the marker with high reliability. The
        system runs entirely within an NVIDIA Jetson Nano and a Raspberry Pi
        camera with a telephoto lens. I achieved 0.22s of latency between the
        appearance of the marker and the system's recognition, with a max
        reliable distance of 80ft.
