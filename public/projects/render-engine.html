      <h3>Project summary</h3>
      <p>
        I designed this program in the fall of 2022 (my sophomore year) as part
        of my final project in Fundamentals of Computing. I used a gfx library
        provided to my class by our instructor. I implemented matrix math in
        accordance with perspective math equations I found on Wikipedia to
        create a simple 3D projection algorithm. I showcased the algorithm with
        a simple cube game.
      </p>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        Getting the first projection to work was the hardest step. The math was
        not difficult to implement, but the difficulties of C were an added
        obstacle. Because I was dealing with matrices of many different sizes,
        it was important to write helper functions that could work on any
        matrix--I used pointer arithmetic to solve this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        After validating that the individual functions worked, debugging the
        projections consisted mainly of trial and error. The perspective
        matrices took a number of different inputs (angles, distances, radii,
        etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, after creating a function that made a simple cube, it was
        simple to build a 3D course with a player and collectible coins using a
        2D array. The game setup function looped through the array and placed a
        cube of corresponding color (i.e. gold for coins, white for player)
        depending on the value in the array.
