      <p>
        This project is a significant aspect of my work as the Principal
        Investigator of the NASA-funded grant that we call Dronehook. The goal
        of Dronehook is to build a fixed-wing craft capable of snagging a
        stationary package without landing. One of our major design requirements
        is to build a package collection station that is as cost-effective and
        low-tech as possible. Our preliminary solution is to use an ArUco marker
        and the associated Python library to detect the marker's location in the
        frame of an onboard camera and fly in its direction. However, a more
        robust solution is needed. As a result, I am exploring how we can use
        lightweight, realtime simulations to plan a 3D path from the plane's
        location to the package intercept point.
