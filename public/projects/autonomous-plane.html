      <p>
        I am currently working on this project as the next step in building an autonomous plane with package pickup capabilities. Using visual input from an onboard camera, the plane will use an ML model trained with many simulation flights. I am currently in the research stage, determining which simulation software to use and how to use the data to train a model.
