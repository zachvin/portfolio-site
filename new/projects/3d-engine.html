        <h2>Problem description</h2>
        <p>
          I created this engine as the final project for my Fundamentals of
          Computing class. I have always been interested in 3D graphics and
          wanted to use my Calc III knowledge of matrices to recreate 3D objects
          on a 2D plane. Because the mathematics behind the projections are
          well-known, the focus of the project was to implement matrix
          operations and create graphics abstractions (in this case, easily
          reproducible cubes) to create a small game.
        </p>
        <h2>Initial approach</h2>
        <p>
          In order to begin work, it was important to have a functional
          understanding of the mathematics. In
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection"
            >this Wikipedia article</a
          >, I assembled all the math I needed. From there, it was simply a
          matter of producing the helper functions.
        </p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Getting the first projection to work was the hardest step. The math
          was not difficult to implement, but the difficulties of C were an
          added obstacle. Because I was dealing with matrices of many different
          sizes, it was important to write helper functions that could work on
          any matrix--I used pointer arithmetic to solve this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          After validating that the individual functions worked, debugging the
          projections consisted mainly of trial and error. The perspective
          matrices took a number of different inputs (angles, distances, radii,
          etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, after creating a function that made a simple cube, it was
          simple to build a 3D course with a player and collectible coins using
          a 2D array. The game setup function looped through the array and
          placed a cube of corresponding color (i.e. gold for coins, white for
          player) depending on the value in the array.
